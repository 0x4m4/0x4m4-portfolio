## Project Overview

As a security researcher (`0x4m4`), I recently implemented a comprehensive **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** solution using the ELK Stack. This project demonstrates how to effectively monitor and analyze security events across multiple systems.

### Key Features

- Real-time log aggregation
- Advanced threat detection
- Custom alert rules
- Automated incident response

## Implementation Details

Here's a sample configuration in `yaml`:

```yaml
input {
  beats {
    port => 5044
    ssl => true
    ssl_certificate => "/etc/logstash/certs/logstash.crt"
    ssl_key => "/etc/logstash/certs/logstash.key"
  }
}
```

### Security Rules

We implemented custom detection rules:

1. *Brute Force Detection*
2. *Privilege Escalation*
3. *Data Exfiltration*

## Code Examples

Here's a Python script for log parsing:

```python
def parse_security_log(log_entry):
    try:
        parsed = json.loads(log_entry)
        if parsed['severity'] == 'HIGH':
            alert_security_team(parsed)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        log_error("Invalid log format")
```

## Network Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Security Sensors] -->|Logs| B[Logstash]
    B --> C[Elasticsearch]
    C --> D[Kibana Dashboard]
    D --> E[Alert System]
```

## Performance Metrics

| Component | Throughput | Latency |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Logstash  | 10k EPS    | 1.2ms   |
| Elastic   | 15k QPS    | 0.8ms   |
| Kibana    | 5k RPS     | 2.1ms   |

## Key Findings

During the implementation, we discovered several interesting patterns:

> "The most effective security measures are often the simplest ones" - 0x4m4

### Critical Vulnerabilities Found

1. Unpatched systems
2. Weak authentication
3. ~~Exposed API keys~~ (*fixed*)

## Future Work

- [ ] Implement ML-based anomaly detection
- [x] Add automated response capabilities
- [ ] Enhance visualization features
